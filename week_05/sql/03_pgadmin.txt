Using pgadmin:

- create a new blank database with the name "car_dealership"

    done

- create a new table named "users_cars" with the following fields:
    - id (auto increment)
    - userID (refers to "id" in users table)
    - carID (refers to "id" in cars table)

    done


- create a new table named "users" with the following fields
    - id (auto increment)
    - first name
    - last name

    done

- create a new table named "cars" with the following fields
    - id (auto increment)
    - make
    - model
    - color
    - year

    done

- populate these tables with at least 5 records each - the more the merrier

    done


- Write the SQL queries to accomplish the following: (write each of your queries below for review)

    - select all records from users

    SELECT * FROM public.users_car


    - select all records from cars where car make = "Toyota"

    SELECT * FROM public.cars WHERE "make" = 'Toyota';


    - use a join to select the first name and car model of every user who has bought a car

    SELECT u."first name", c."model"
    FROM public.cars as c
    JOIN public.users_cars as uc
    ON c."id" = uc."carID"
    JOIN public.users as u
    ON u."id" = uc."userID";


    - use a join to select the first and last name of everyone who has bought a red car

    SELECT u."first name", u."last name"
    FROM public.cars as c
    JOIN public.users_cars as uc
    ON c."id" = uc."carID"
    JOIN public.users as u
    ON u."id" = uc."userID"
    WHERE c."color" = 'red';

    - use an insert statement to create a new record in each table

    INSERT INTO public.cars(
        make, model, color, year)
        VALUES ('Opel', 'Astra', 'yellow', '1995');

    INSERT INTO public.users(
        "first name", "last name")
        VALUES ('Jacky', 'Daniels');

    INSERT INTO public.users_cars(
        "userID", "carID")
        VALUES ('7', '7');

    - use sql to update a record in the "cars" table

    UPDATE public.cars
        SET color='purple', year=2011
        WHERE "make" = 'Ford';

    - delete one record from the database

    DELETE FROM public.cars WHERE "make" ='Opel';
