HEROKU DEPLOYMENT / SWITCHING DJANGO'S DB BACKEND
=================================================

1) High level steps to get our project up and running on Heroku

    Make an account.
    Download heroku (for terminal): sudo snap install --classic heroku
    Download the django_heroku python package into project env.
    Make Procfile
    pip freeze > requirements.txt (heroku uses this to install the python packages).

    Login
    heroku create
    Push your commits.
    Resolve errors and push again until succes.

        heroku run python manage.py migrate (create a database on heroku, it uses the models.py file)
    heroku run python3 manage.py loaddata datadump.json (load the data to the created database)


2) What do we need to prepend to a python command in order to
run code remotely on a Heroku server?

    - heroku run


3) What does a database connection string consist of?

    - Port
    - name db
    - username

    - In the settings.py file / DATABASES

5) High level steps to migrate a DB from SQLite to Postgres

    1. create a database on postgres,
    2. dump your sqlite to json file.
    3. push datadump
    4. load your dump into your postgres database.


YOUR QUESTIONS
==============

3) BLAKE: Working with different branches and pushing to Heroku, how can we guarantee uptime?

    - Set up your heroku app first time.
    - Keep develloping locally, without pushing to heroku.
    - When local is ready for update, push.
        - When working with multiple branches, only the master should be pushed to heroku. Branches should be merged
        with the master when ready.
    - When running into errors, nothing online will change, until all errors are resolved.

5) MING: After changing data ownership permissions, what steps you need to follow to make
	that reflected in your app?


7) ROBERT:

	* How to push your database information up to a remote DB on Heroku?
